Oh man, just stumbled out of that theater and let me tell you, A Working Man—what a ride. Sitting there in the dark, back aching like I’ve been carrying bricks myself. The popcorn crumbs are still itching my neck, ugh. But the  , it's stuck in my head like a catchy tune you can’t shake off. 

> So there's this scene, right? Where the main guy, what's his name, keeps pacing like a tiger in a too-small cage, and all I can think about is that time I lost my keys and just circled my house like a madman. The tension's just that tight—feels like suffocating under a thick blanket but you can’t move cause you’ve got a cat sleeping on you. I swear, I could feel the guy's desperation close enough to taste it, like metallic coffee. How do you even 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   vibes like that?

And the sound—the CLANK-CLANK of the machines! God, like being inside a Terminator’s kitchen. It's so loud you’d think the walls of the theater were made of tin foil, but it's right, y’know? Fits the pulse. There was that part where... Oh, what was it? When he’s finally looking out a window, seeing just a strip of sky, and it’s as if he’s on the moon, yeah. Floating, yet grounded by gravity's dull pull—a big metaphor, maybe. Whatever, made me feel like the time I realized my coffee got cold. 

Remember someone told me to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   𝘰𝘯𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘦, but there's something about the theater—sticky floors, whisper-hushing that—ah, makes you a part of it. A live, breathing beast.

Oh! Almost forgot, at one point, some old song plays in the background, and it’s like a blender mixing nostalgia into the present. The protagonist’s faces twist, reflecting memories of simpler times or maybe he’s just got a cramp. Can’t tell. It resonates, though, like the time I found an old mixtape and every track was a skip in time. Weirdly comforting.

I'm all jumbled now, brain's mush. Like, would I re𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it? Hmm. Yeah, maybe. If my heart could take it again. 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   for some quiet night in the future. Or just let the feelings sink in deep, like stones into the ocean. 

So, here comes the randomness:
```c
#include <io𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮>
int main() { int thoughts = 0, feelings; std::cin >> feelings; thoughts += feelings  8; std::cout << Output:  << thoughts; return 0; }
```
